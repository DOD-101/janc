# Just Another Neovim Config

That's really it. Nothing all too crazy.

## Focuses

- Keep bloat out
- 100% Lua (I don't wanna learn Vim Script)
- Keep your focus on what you're doing without distraction

## Installing

`mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim ; cd ~/.config/nvim ; git clone https://github.com/DOD-101/janc.git`

Then set `$NVIM_APPNAME = nvim/janc`

After this open up nvim and everything should be setup.

I recommend running `:ListLangTools` to get a list of all the tools the config is setup to use.
Then install the things you want.
