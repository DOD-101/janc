# Just Another Neovim Config

That's really it. Nothing all too crazy.

## Focuses

- Keep bloat out
- 100% Lua (I don't wanna learn Vim Script)
- Keep your focus on what you're doing without distraction

## Installing

`mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim ; cd ~/.config/nvim ; git clone https://github.com/DOD-101/janc.git`

Then set `$NVIM_APPNAME = nvim/janc`

After this open up nvim and everything should be setup.

I recommend running `:ListLangTools` to get a list of all the tools the config is setup to use.
Then decide on how you want to install these things.
You can either use Mason or your system's package manager.
